Stack, Store the data in the form of array of object.
Good for searching and fetching the data. bad for inserting and deleting the data.
Stack follows fifo principle which is element that is added at last and removing at first.
duplicates and multiple nulll values are allowed. 

Stack has four methods 
pop()- delete the element and return element
push() - add the element
peek() - print the top element
isEmpty() - check values in the stack


import java.util.Stack;

class Employee {
    String name;
    int salary;

    Employee(String name, int salary) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = salary;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " - " + salary;
    }
}

public class StackDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Stack<Employee> info = new Stack<>();

        System.out.println("Employee Stack:");

        info.push(new Employee("Suraj", 50000));
        info.push(new Employee("Kumar", 25000));
        info.push(new Employee("SK", 15000));

        System.out.println("Top Employee: " + info.peek());

        while (!info.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(info.pop());
        }
    }
}
