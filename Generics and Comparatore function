We having two type of collection, non generic collection and generic collection. Non generic collection, it is the collection of hetrogenous object. Generic collection, it is the collection of homogenous object.
if we use same data type of  values inside the parameter then we use generics, it is does not allow the different data type values.
Whenever, we sorting the object based on one parameter, we will be using comparable function unit. comparable interface contain compare to function.
Steps to sort the object using comparable 
object should implement comparable then make it as generics.
using comparator interface, it contain compareto(), to check to two parameter values which is small that is comes in first
