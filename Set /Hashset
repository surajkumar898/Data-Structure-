It is the sub- Interface of collection interface. It is defined in Java.util.package. 
Characterization of interface 
Insertion order is not  mandate, Set does not allow duplicate element, we can add only one null values, Set does not have index. So we cannot add or remove the elements based an index we can iterate set only by using 
for each loop and iterators method.
It has three implementation class are 
Hashset, Linked Hash Set, Treeset.
Hashset
It is the implementation class of set interface.
Initial capacity of hashset is 60, Implementation capacity of hashset is current capacity *2.
Hash set does not allow duplicate elements. 
Insertion order is not maintain
values are added based on hashcode.
hetrogenous data is allowed.
It accept only one null values. 
It implements clonable and serizable marker interface.
Example of Hashset
import java.util.*;

public class SetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Set<String> fruits = new HashSet<>();
        fruits.add("Apple");
        fruits.add("Banana");
        fruits.add("Mango");
        fruits.add("Banana"); // Duplicate NOT added

        System.out.println("Fruits: " + fruits); // Order not guaranteed

        fruits.remove("Banana");

        System.out.println("\nAfter removal:");
        for (String fruit : fruits) {
            System.out.println(fruit);
        }

        System.out.println("\nTotal fruits: " + fruits.size());
    }
}
